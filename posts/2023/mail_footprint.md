# Reducing my mail footprint

Over the last years, part of trying to reduce my overall carbon footprint has been to take care of my mail.
Issue in pro life and brought up by lab

First what why is mail carbon footprint.

## Mail = Cloud
Cloud bad
Represented by little cute white xloud
For once we welcome trend of simplification in logos otherwise we would have happy faces and clouds watering plants
Reality is of course less cute, and any file  "on the cloud" is in fact on a computer (called servers, obfuscating a little more the process) in a more or less huge data center.
Those are not like a couple of hard drives, they are on 24/7 and are becoming more and more of an issue.
Streaming demand is going up and this is taking a lot, A LOT, of space and energy.
Yep, data centers need to multiply and soil conservation is something that should be taken into account here.
Energy also obviously, these computers are always on and draw electricity to run, and also to cool off.
"But we have or will have green energy!" you say. Maybe, but that data center is not necessarily next to you. Most accessed content is duplicated to data centers close to you, but often a lot of content, or the last parts of the video you're watching is on a much bigger center further away, possibly in another country.
Moving data around long distances like also has a big cost of course.

Back to specificities of mail
We are talking about mail here, and comparatively to the last 1080p episode of ?mean girls?look at trends? one mail ridiculously light weight.

Indeed mail is only text, which is quite easy to encode efficiently.
And yes, "only text" is correct, mail protocols were made for text and support other stuff (like an attached image) by converting it to text.

Compare size of mail to jpg of sphinx d'Ã‰gypte, demander permission a Karim debbache.

It was not made to accommodate large files, and it is likely that your mail client will complain if you try to send too big a file.

Another possible source of weight in a mail is formatting. You can make your mail a little nicer by using html and eventually css, the same lightweight protocols as for webpages.
Favored by companies sending ads, as it gives a sense of professionalism. It can also be used to hide the true address behind a link, watch out !

Typically mail clients do not add that much html code

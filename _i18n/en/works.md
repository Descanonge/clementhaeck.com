I am aiming at quantifying the effects of sub-mesoscale dynamics (~0.1-10km) on phytoplankton productivity and biodiversity.
To that end I use satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to detect fronts, in which I quantify the amount of Chlorophyll-a, also obtained from satellite.
I am conducting this study in the North Atlantic, around the Gulf Stream.

So far I have been able to quantify an increase of Chlorophyll in fronts, related to the local upwelling of nutrients. The Chlorophyll increase is more intense for stronger fronts than weak fronts, however because they are much more scarce the overall effect on the Chlorophyll budget is less important for strong fronts.

I have also been able to detect a spring bloom onset that is a few days earlier in fronts than in the background. This can be explained by the restratification effect of sub-mesoscale fronts. The bloom is also longer in fronts by a few days.

We are planning to extend this study to the phytoplankton composition, and to other study regions.

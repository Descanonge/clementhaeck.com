        description: >-
          This working group was created to implement laboratory-wide Carbon-reducing
          measures that were proposed by LOCEAN-Climaction.
          It resulted in the immediate adoption of several smaller measures, and in the
          submission of some key measures to the vote of all laboratory personnel.
          Mainly, the decision to restrict travel by a personnal Carbon quota on par
          with the Paris Agreement, was adopted with a large majority.

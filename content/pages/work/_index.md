# My Work

## PhD

Studies over the past two decades seem to indicate that ocean currents at small scales (of order of magnitudes between 1km and 10km) have a strong influence on phytoplankton. However, precisely quantifying their impact on the ecosystem as a whole -- that is, on regions typically spanning thousands of kilometers -- is challenging.
During my thesis, I attempted to quantify the impact of fronts (key structures at small scales) on phytoplankton in a large area around the Gulf Stream, using satellite imagery.

We utilized satellite sea surface temperature (SST) to detect the fronts. We then quantified the chlorophyll (also from satellite data) inside and outside these fronts.

First of all, let us note the importance (and potential difficulty) of separating regions with different biogeochemical regimes, as well as considering potential large-scale gradients within these regions.
We then demonstrate the *local* impact of fronts in certain regions, an impact that is all the more considerable for fronts of higher *intensity*.
However, when considering the entire bio-region and accounting for the surface area occupied by the fronts, we observe an overall much weaker impact.

Furthermore, we have shown an earlier bloom onset within the fronts, by one to two weeks.

These findings are presented in the article ["Satellite data reveal earlier and stronger phytoplankton blooms over fronts in the Gulf Stream region"](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1741-2023), as well as in my [PhD manuscript (in french)](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04249198).

## Continuation

I am continuing to work on refining the methodology that we established.
We have started to apply it to data of phytoplankton composition generated by Roy El Hourany[^1].
It has also been applied in the California Current region[^2], with the aim (amongst other) of extending the results above to other areas.
Several avenues of study are also being considered: decadal trends, the influence some methodological parameters (beyond those already tested),...

All the scripts used are available on the repository [gitlab.in2p3.fr/clementhaeck/submeso-color](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/clementhaeck/submeso-color). I am currently revamping them to make them more accessible and easily reusable, splitting them into two separate projects: [heterogeneity-index](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/biofronts/heterogeneity-index) and [data-assistant](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/biofronts/data-assistant).
